ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AriadnaMaldonadoGrieco. Im a 28 year old starting web developer, currently living in Argentina. I speak both Spanish and English fluently.
 Iâ€™m interested in front end developing, coding with Javascript, making fun and accesible design, and most of all: Learning new things everyday.
 
 I just learned: Responsive design with flexbox.
 
 Iâ€™m currently starting to learn: Sass and bootstrap.
 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Jr level project I possibly can to get more and more practice and develop my habilities!
